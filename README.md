# BigInt
The maximum limit of _Unsigned Long Long Int_ in C/C++ is 18446744073709551615, a 20 digit number. While languages like C++/Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers). C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language along with basic arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication along with applications such as Factorial, Fibonacci etc.

## Objective
Add support for Big Integers (numbers greater than 18446744073709551615) in C along with basic mathematical operations and functions.
